            <h4> Introduction </h4>
            <p>The amygdala plays an essential role in emotion, motivation, and memory, especially those associated with anxiety and negativity. A prevalent pathway in the amygdala, the fear conditioning pathway, encodes fear memories associated with contextual stimuli. Fear conditioning, a specific type of pavlovian conditioning, is a type of conditioned learning which takes advantage of a subject’s instinctive response to have a given stimulus become increasingly effective in evoking said response. This is done by reinforcement, such that two stimuli are presented in close temporal proximity with an appropriate intensity, and is characterized as a learned response. As amygdala dysfunction has been implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, addiction, and autism, being able to precisely alter and analyze the underlying neural mechanisms using an in silico model could advance clinical therapies. Previous studies suggest that changes in the frequency of oscillation couplings between gamma oscillations and specific portions of the theta cycle correlate with the states of fear and safety. Specifically, theta-gamma coupling overlap was increased during states of fear, while the coupling was suppressed during perceived safety. There are two primary theories for the underlying mechanism of gamma oscillations: pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) rhythms and interneuronal network gamma (ING) rhythms. Whilst many neuroscientists model gamma oscillations and many model neural circuitry, existing neural network models do not incorporate both. This study of fear conditioning in the amygdala was designed to unify the implication of gamma oscillations and network circuitry in learning.</p>
            <h4>So ...</h4>
            <p>In this study, the Pavlovian pathway in the amygdala was computaionally modeled in Matlab to investigate learning to associate two stimjuli.</p>
            <p>Because of the correlation between gamma oscillations and encoding fear states, the underlying mechanism of gamma oscillations in the amygdala was investigated in slice culture, as well as a simplified network of excitatory (E cells) and inhibitory (I cells) neurons.</p>

                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>In this study, we will develop an in silico model of the pavlovian fear conditioning pathway in the amygdala to illuminate the mechanism underlying the learned association between a neutral and an aversive input.</p>
                  <p>The amygdala is named for its almond shape, is a component of the limbic system that is located within the temporal lobe of the brain, and plays an essential role in emotion, motivation, and memory. </p>
                  <p>According to the encyclopedia Britannica, pavlovian conditioning, also known as classical conditioning, is a type of conditioned learning which takes advantage of a subject’s instinctive response to have a given stimulus become increasingly effective in evoking said response. This is done by reinforcement, such that two stimuli are presented in close temporal proximity and with an appropriate intensity [2]. </p>
                  <p>To design our computational model, we model relevant regional neural structures linked to the pathway: the lateral amygdala (input), the basal amygdala, the prelimbic cortex, and the central amygdala (output). The connectivity of the model will be validated through prior findings, as well as through experimental data from slice cultures. Furthermore, these slice cultures will be used to study the role of network synchrony in learning to associate a memory with fear. Because neural oscillations are thought to play a mechanistic role in synchrony, they will also be analyzed in slice culture, and their effect modeled in silico.</p>
                  <p>The in-vitro model itself will be validated with references from previous studies. These past data sets can help confirm whether the input/output relation would have triggered the pathway for a fear conditioned response. This allows for greater reliability and precision in evaluating possible inputs. Statistical tests will be employed to determine the significance of the correlation between the biological data and the in silico model. </p>
                  <p>Regional neural network responses will be compared against pre-existing data. Some such assumptions are that the lateral amygdala displays transient signal responses to conditioned stimuli, whilst the basal amygdala and the prelimbic cortex both display sustained responses to conditioned stimuli [1]. The literature tells us that this sustained feedback from the prelimbic cortex is linked to the freezing behavior evoked in primates in reaction to a threatening stimulus [1]. Previous studies also combined extracellular recordings and optogenetics to study oscillatory correlations with behavioral responses and concluded that the onset of a freezing behavioral expression of fear correlated with sustained 4hz oscillations of prefrontal amygdala circuits [6]. Preconditioning and postconditioning neural responses from relevant regions will be quantified and the significance of their relationship compared. Quantifying connection strengths and neuromodulator effects will come from computational models developed in the past, as often interactions between neural structures and components are qualified from in vivo experiments but unable to be accurately quantified. </p>
                  <p> To construct the in silico model, Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal models will be used for individual neurons, and the most prominent type of neurons found in each of the relevant neural structures will be developed from them. This will be similar for the modeling of interneurons, of which GABAergic will be one -- as it is the most common interneuron in the basolateral amygdala [1]. The most impactful neuromodulators on the pavlovian fear conditioning pathway in the amygdala are dopamine and norepinephrine [1]. These will be the two neuromodulators modeled, including there effect when binding to dopamine 1 versus dopamine 2 receptors, and norepinephrine beta versus norepinephrine alpha receptors, on said pathway [1]. More details on modeling decisions are presented in other modals. </p>
                  <h4>Significance</h4>
                  <p>Learning the fundamental emotional significance of a stimulus is an essential skill for survival. Not only for determining the behavioral response to a predator -- fight or flight, but also for modulating aspects of memory and cognition. It is known that emotionally arousing events have a higher probability for retainment than do neutral ones. This fact is especially true for negative events. Moreover, the amygdala is the source of many neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in developing youth. Previous studies have implicated amygdala dysfunction in anxiety disorders, addiction, and more complex neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism. As research on the amygdala advances, it’ll open the way to the development of new treatments for and/or greater understanding  of these disorders.

                  <p>The general connectivity of the system is shown in the Figure above and will be modeled as follows. Although, the quantified connectivity is subject to change based on experimental data. </p>
                  <p>As the lateral amygdala doesn’t receive feedback from the basal amygdala nor the prelimbic cortex, it will be the “input” of the in silico model. Biologically the lateral amygdala is known to project to the basal amygdala, this will be mimicked in the model, accordingly. The basal amygdala projects to the prelimbic cortex. Pre-existing literature asserts that there is a dense bidirectional connectivity between the basal amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex. As such, prelimbic cortex neurons will project to the basal amygdala as well. The basal amygdala also projects to the central amygdala. The central amygdala will be modeled as the “output” of the system. It is a known and key output region of the primate amygdala [1]. This output of the central amygdala is the behavioral response evoked by the stimulus. As mentioned above, the primary behavioral response being evaluated by this study is freezing, with the hope that the in silico model may be expanded to account for the fleeing behavioral response, as well. </p>

                  <p>Based on the Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) neuronal model, the WB(Wang-Buzsaki) model of an inhibitory interneuron focuses on modelling a a class of inhibitory basket cells: parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV+). The WB model is of note since it features a lessened hyperpolarization after an action potential relative to the other 2 main model formats of the H-H neuron: RTM & Erisir. The difference between the firing threshold and lowest voltage is ~15mV which more accurately represents the reference experimental results.</p>
                  <p>These PV+ cells are capable of high frequency firing rates capable of the gamma frequency of (30~80)Hz. PV+ cells make up the greatest portion of inhibitory interneurons in the BLA complex and are crucial for gamma oscillations in the amygdala. However, in our project these single cell models only apply for gamma oscillation analysis; specifically our ING vs PING analysis of cellular circuit oscillation. </p>

                  <h4>Biological Basis</h4>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Dopamine And Norepinephrine</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/neuromodulators.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>Based on previous research, it is known that neuromodulators alter the excitability of prelimbic and basal amygdala cells, during fear conditioning and extinction. How neuromodulators interact with the neural structures in the system will be modeled as follows.</p>
                  <ul class="list-inline">
                    <li>Dopamine D1 receptors and Norepinephrine beta receptors are activated at high concentrations. </li>
                    <li>Dopamine D2 receptors and Norepinephrine alpha receptors are activated at all concentration levels.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In the basolateral amygdala, norepinephrine beta receptors inhibits the slow after-hyperpolarization that occurs after trains of action potentials, thereby facilitating spike firing. They also suppress feed-forward GABAergic inhibition of basolateral projection neurons. </p>
                  <p>In the prelimbic cortex, D1 receptors affect cellular excitability by shifting the activation threshold of the persistent sodium current toward a more hyperpolarized potential and slow inactivation, affecting slow excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. Similar to in the basolateral amygdala, dopamine 1 receptors decrease the spike threshold, which decreases the slowly inactivating potassium current. D1 receptor activation reduces the half-width and amplitude of isolated dendritic calcium ion spikes. D1 receptor stimulation has also been shown to increase the NMDA component of excitatory postsynaptic potential cells in the prefrontal cortex, of which the prelimbic cortex is a part. At low dopamine, D2 receptor activation enhances GABA_A-like synaptic currents in the prefrontal cortex and decreases non-NMDA currents. Excitation of norepinephrine alpha 2 A receptors reduces the concentration of cAMP, which in turn decreases hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel conductance, causing hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential, a significant increase in the input resistance of the cell membrane, and an increase in the number of evoked spikes. Stimulation of norepinephrine beta receptors increases the NMDA mediated calcium current and the occurrence of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. It is important to note that inhibition of norepinephrine beta receptors has been reported to reduce both freezing and spontaneous activity in prelimbic cortex. </p>
                  <p><i>An in depth diagram of dopamine interacting with this pathway, developed from [1], is depicted in Figure 22.</i></p>
                  <!--Insert Network Architecture Picture here-->
                  <p>The effect of dopamine on inhibitory activity in the pavlovian pathway, combined with the conclusions that neuromodulator release in the pathway results from freezing and theta-gamma coupled oscillations also result from freezing, provokes the question of dopamine’s role in the formation of gamma oscillations. Because the mechanism underlying gamma oscillations is inconclusive, Here, we will consider both known mechanisms in the context of dopamine. </p>

                  <h4>Modeling Reinforcement Mechanisms<i> In Silico</i></h4>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Reinforcement "R" Neuron, Extinction "X" Neuron, Omega Neuron</p>
                  <p>This study modeled reinforcement by integrating primary (U neuron) and secondary (S neuron) reinforcement, using a reinforcement neuron (R neuron). The primary reinforcement method simulated by the U neuron is the shock (US). The S neuron ensures sufficiently strong NM feedback to BLA, in response to CS, mediated by potentiation in the BL. The influence of the U and S neurons on the R neuron, respectively is calculated according to the formulas presented in Appendix 8. The effect of the R neuron is to simulate the neuromodulator release triggered by freezing, effecting the virtual brain state in the same manner as high concentration of DA and NE did in (Pendyam et al., 2011). It is important to note that because this model focuses on forward pairing conditioning, the R neuron was coded to fire transiently with US onset, precluding a CS that begins after onset from causing conditioning.</p>
                  <h4>Backpropagation</h4>
                  <p>The main method by which reinforcement occurs is the feedback loop of neuromodulators that alter conductivity and connectivity of the basolateral amygdala. Another term for this feedback, is backpropagation, which provides the central mechanism of learning for this model. For principal cells in the BLA, dendritic membrane potentials are determined by backpropagation graded spike-like signals, whose magnitude is a function of the depolarization of the proximal compartment of principal cells and direct input from the R neuron. Note that dendritic membrane potentials were not modeled as a function of neuromodulators. As gamma oscillations were determined to be ING, the study instead simulated the effects of NM feedback on the inhibitory interneurons. A function of calcium levels, inhibitory backpropagation was controlled by recurrent input from excitatory principal cells and input from the reinforcement neuron, via neuromodulation. This is in line with prior findings that stimulation of norepinephrine beta receptors increases the NMDA mediated calcium current and the occurrence of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (Ji et al., 2008). Backpropagation was calculated using the formulas presented in Appendix 9. The synaptic connectivity of the BLA was then re-evaluated, followed by the CEm, in the same method described previously. The resulting increase in the CEm re-activates the reinforcement-related neurons, bringing this feedback loop full circle. The last parameters to be updated at the end of a trial is the learning factors. Implicit learning mediates hippocampal and cortical inhibitory interneuron activity; incidental learning applies to hippocampus-independent activity and mediates potentiated cortical cells (‘transformed’ cells). These learning factors are linearly additive, only increasing if there’s activity in the cortex and a conditioned stimulus present.</p>

                  <h4>What</h4>
                  <p>Oscillations are the simplest form of coherent network behavior in the brain. Previous literature indicates that the oscillatory state of a network causes the system to experience input bias via non-random input allowance, temporarily linking neurons into assemblies, facilitating synaptic plasticity, supporting temporal representation, and enhancing long term information consolidation. Previous literature suggests that changes in the frequency of oscillation couplings between gamma oscillations and specific theta cycle portions are capable of correlating with and/or mediating a shift between the states of fear and safety. Specifically: theta-gamma coupling overlap was increased during states of fear while the coupling was suppressed during perceived safety. These theta-gamma couplings are referred to as a complex’s synchrony [7]. </p>
                  <p>The synchronous activity of the local field potentials of the BLA, PFC, and HPC complex facilitate communication between each pathway. Similar to the  effects of registered gamma-theta oscillation coupling changes, shifts in the theta synchrony of this complex correlates with bulk perception of and distinction between fear and safety. Through experimentation with oscillatory rhythms, the BLA, PFC, & HPC complex was shown to express 2 consistent qualities: </p>

                  <p>The lateral amygdala displays transient signal responses to conditioned stimuli, whilst the basal amygdala and the prelimbic cortex both display sustained responses to conditioned stimuli [1]. The literature tells us that this sustained feedback from the prelimbic cortex is linked to the freezing behavior evoked in primates in reaction to a threatening stimulus [1]. Previous studies also combined extracellular recordings and optogenetics to study oscillatory correlations with behavioral responses and concluded that the onset of a freezing behavioral expression of fear correlated with theta-gamma coupled oscillations in the pathway [15].</p>
                  <p>Based on previous research, it is known that neuromodulators alter the excitability of prelimbic and basal amygdala cells, during fear conditioning and extinction. The most impactful neuromodulators on the pavlovian fear conditioning pathway in the amygdala are dopamine and norepinephrine [1]. Here, we focuse on the implication of dopamine release on gamma oscillations in the pavlovian pathway.</p>
                  <p>The following was demonstrated by the in silico model designed in [1]. In the prelimbic cortex, D1 receptors affect cellular excitability by shifting the activation threshold of the persistent sodium current toward a more hyperpolarized potential and slow inactivation, affecting slow excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. Similar to in the basolateral amygdala, dopamine 1 receptors decrease the spike threshold, which decreases the slowly inactivating potassium current. D1 receptor activation reduces the half-width and amplitude of isolated dendritic calcium ion spikes. D1 receptor stimulation has also been shown to increase the NMDA component of excitatory postsynaptic potential cells in the prefrontal cortex, of which the prelimbic cortex is a part. D2 receptor activation enhances GABA_A-like synaptic currents in the prefrontal cortex and decreases non-NMDA currents [1].  <i>An in depth diagram of dopamine interacting with this pathway, developed from [1], is depicted in the <a href="#portfolioModal3">Network Architecture</a> modal</i></p>
                  
                  <p>The effect of dopamine on inhibitory activity in the pavlovian pathway, combined with the conclusions that neuromodulator release in the pathway results from freezing and theta-gamma coupled oscillations also result from freezing, provokes the question of dopamine’s role in the formation of gamma oscillations. Because the mechanism underlying gamma oscillations is inconclusive, Here, we will consider both known mechanisms in the context of dopamine. </p>
                  <h4>PING vs. ING</h4>
                  <figure><img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/ingping.png" alt="" width="45%"><figcaption font-size="smaller">Figure 23</figcaption></figure>
                  
                  <p>The two primary theories are: <i>pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma</i> (PING) rhythms and <i>interneuronal network gamma</i> (ING) rhythms [9]. Both of which correspond to network motifs that are common throughout the cortex [2].</p>
                  <p>PING describes a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, referred to as E-cells and I-cells, respectively, in which activity of E-cells stimulates I-cells that in turn inhibit the firing of E-cells, such that upon resumption of firing, the E-cells are brought closer to synchrony (Figure 23) [12]. This network stands in contrast to that of ING.</p>
                  <p>Driven entirely by I-cells, ING works through the inhibition resulting from some I-cells firing, which delays other I-cells’ spiking to have them participate in the next inhibitory volley. This results in I-cells synchronizing E-cells [2].</p>

                  <h5>Based on current available literature and numerical analysis of simulated network models, we conclude that whilst ING can’t be ruled out, PING seems the more likely mechanism underlying gamma rhythms in the pavlovian pathway. This is in agreement with the conclusions of [2].</h5>

                  <p><b>1.</b> If the oscillations observed in the basolateral amygdala are PING, then for dopamine modulation to generate a stable PING that wouldn’t have occurred otherwise, this paper assumes that the initial inhibitory drive is not strong enough to stimulate enough I-cells to fire. More negative inhibitory drive reduced the number of I-cells spiking and diminished PING, in accordance with expectations (Figures 2, 3, and 4). This makes sense, as reduction in the amount of stimulated cells directly induces a reduction in the synaptic input per cell, thus PING breaks down  [4]. </p>

                  <p> With a fundamental assumption confirmed, the reappearance of PING through the injection of positive drive was evaluated. Simulations found that whilst PING appeared when given low values of positive drive, too high of positive drive had diminishing returns (Figure 6 and 7). Moreover, the time to establish a clear and stable PING extended (Figures 1, 6 and 7). Note that this disappearance happens at a much slower rate than the loss of PING via negative drive, as can be seen when comparing Figures 2 and 6, as well as Figures 3 and 7. The primary difference to examine, here, is the ratio of I-cells to E-cells firing. Whilst negative drive to I-cells lowers this ratio, positive drive raises it. </p>

                  <p> Synchronous oscillations typically occur for a specific ratio of mean E- to I-cell firing rate [2]. When both firing rates move in opposite directions, the ratio between mean E and I cell firing rate varies quickly and the gamma oscillation is disrupted [2]. This phenomenon occurs, with the introduction of positive drive to I-cells, as it causes the firing rate of I-cells to increase, resulting in more inhibitory input to E-cells and a decrease in the firing rate of E-cells [2]. Interestingly, random fluctuating light pulse activation of I-cells was found to enhance gamma frequencies relative to other frequency bands, which logically lines up with the possibility of dopamine mechanistically contributing to the emergence of gamma oscillations, by increasing spontaneous inhibitory network activity [2][1].</p>

                  <p><b>2. </b>In the follow up PING analysis, drive to the I-cells was made negative to simulate being harder to activate. Because D1Rs were not modeled in this network, their effect was modeled approximately, by lowering the spiking threshold as if dopamine had depolarized the cell by 4 mV and by varying the synaptic input from E-cells to I-cells to roughly simulate the effect of increasing R_in, as has been found experimentally [10]. Raising this synaptic input incrementally resulted in a large increase in clarity of PING (Figure 13). Too much synaptic input, as expected, faded PING (Figure 15). Supporting this finding, one study suggested that there are intrinsic neural mechanisms, through which neuromodulation can change the spike phase in response to oscillatory input [2]. This same study also concluded that depolarization of I-cells increased gamma power in the LFP, whilst hyperpolarizing the I-cells reduced gamma power in the LFP [2]. In a realistically heterogeneous network, a PING needs to be established rapidly, as is demonstrated in these findings [4].</p>

                  <p><b>1.</b> The most robust ING requires gap junctions, which are present in the pavlovian pathway of the amygdala [5]. In typical brain states, I-cells demonstrate a firing rate far below the common gamma frequency of 40 Hz [2]. Because glutamate has been shown to increase the firing rate of I-cells and the drive to interneurons, the effect of the latter on the former was evaluated in an ING network [7][2]. The results showed a significantly decreased firing rate in response to decreased inhibitory drive via I_i_(bar) (Figure 17)(Figure 16). When increasing I_i_(bar) the opposite was true (Figure 18). [2] confirms the validity of these results, expanding to say that raising drive to E-cells should have a very minimal impact, as compared to activating I-cells in the local circuit.</p>

                  <p><b>2. </b>In the follow up ING analysis, spiking threshold was varied to primarily test the implication for the binding of dopamine, which has been found to lower spiking thresholds, as well as an approximate test of the slight depolarization or hyperpolarization of I-cells on ING [1][14]. Raising the spiking threshold resulted in an increase in firing rate, whilst lowering the spiking threshold decreased it (Figures 20 and 21). This may occur, as a higher spiking threshold reduces inhibition of I-cells. Nevertheless, this finding stands contrary to the proposal that dopamine modulates gamma oscillations in the pavlovian pathway. Dopamine modulation via decreasing spiking thresholds, causing increased spontaneous inhibitory network activity, lays at the foundation of this proposition [1]. </p>

                  <p><b>Conclusion:	</b>In conclusion, only one test failed to support the prospect of dopamine playing a mechanistic role in gamma oscillations. As this result came from an ING test, this paper concludes that PING may be the more likely mechanism of gamma rhythms regulating the pavlovian pathway. However, enough experimentation supports ING that it cannot be ruled out. This conclusion is in agreement with that of [2], as mentioned previously. The numerical analysis that led to this conclusion is presented below.</p>

                  <h4>Tissue Preparation</h4>
                  <p>Mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane administered through a soaked tissue of isoflurane being introduced to the mouse cage duct. While waiting for the anesthetic to take full effect a sucrose solution was prepared in a square container. The then fully anesthetized mouse was quickly decapitated using a guillotine. The mouse head was then placed in the sucrose solution container and the brain extracted. </p>
                  <h4>Tissue Slicing</h4>
                  <p>Coronal slices were taken at 40-μm intervals until the Basolateral Amygdala and Hippocampal regions were present. This region is of significance as it experiences locally generated intrinsic oscillations allowing for all other areas to be cut away to present for listen potential noise during analysis. These BLA and HC sections were cut away from the slices and moved for oscillation analysis. </p>
                  <h4>Slice Culture Setup</h4>
                  <p>The slice regions were taken to the interface chamber. The chamber had the brain slice submerged and washed with ACSF (Artificial CerebroSpinal Fluid) to remove any remaining sucrose solution. Next EPHYS solution was pumped into the liquid solution wash to provide nutrients and waste removal for the slice culture. An syringe was used to fill electrodes with ACSF for single cell electrophysiology recordings. LabChart was used to gather data. A 0.1Hz high pass filter was used to stabilize baseline recordings; 60Hz noise was also removed. Kainate acid activates glutamate receptors to increase excitability to enhance brain activity for slice on slide recording without necessitating the slice to be positioned on the mesh.</p>
                  <h4>Slice Culture Analysis</h4>
                  <p>Electrode was inserted to the BLA, as shown in the top left section of the figure shown above, and left until a clear gamma oscillation signal stabilized. A real time spectrogram reading, as shown in the figure above, was used to determine the stability of the signal; with brighter sections showing stronger oscillations. After roughly 5mins of registered stable activity the slice was washed with Ethanol and monitored for changes in behavior. The ethanol wash would prevent inhibitory interneurons from playing a part in oscillatory behavior. After the ethanol treatment a return to a ACSF solution wash was done and behavioral changes recorded. The data of gamma oscillations were compiled and then graphed in a Power vs Frequency graph to better illustrate the gamma frequency pattern and its weight throughout the entire recording of the slice. A statistical analysis of the Power/Frequency graph is shown above as a box plot to explicitly show the weight of gamma oscillatory behavior mentioned previously.</p>
                  <h4>Conclusions</h4>
                  <p><ul>
                  	<li>Power and Frequency Relationships firmly establish slice oscillations as gamma oscillations</li>
                  	<li>There were no signs of gamma oscillations during Ethanol treatment phase meaning the pyramidal interneurons were incapable of inducing gamma oscillations.</li>
                  	<li>Evidence of gamma oscillations after the Ethanol treatment coupled with an absence of gamma oscillations during the Ethanol wash point to oscillatory behavior being induced by inhibitory interneurons that were explicitly silenced during the Ethanol wash. </li>
                  	<li>For gamma oscillations to be solely supported by the inhibitory interneurons supports the ING (interneural Gamma) circuit which functions solely through inhibitory interneurons.</li>

The correlated sustained activity in the basal amygdala and formation of gamma oscillations is associated with long term potentiation (LTP), but not with its failure. Both LTP and gamma oscillations are based on the strengthening of synapses, such that cells that fire together are more likely to do so in the future, thus  neural rhythms will be implemented similarly to LTP.</p>

                  <p>In the model, if there is a conditional stimulus, then the principal cortical neuronal firing rate is unity (one), otherwise there will be no activity. The array of activity in the lateral amygdala (LA) consists of the activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically principal and inhibitory firing rates, as well as the firing rate of the cortical activity directly resulting from incidental learning, termed ‘transformed’ cortical neurons. The stipulation that the activity in the LA of an unconditioned rat or mouse is transient based on expected biological understanding has, therefore, been mimicked as the unconditioned LA is dependent on cortical activity, determined by the presence of a conditioned stimulus, as described above. The total firing rate of the LA is the fraction of the LA not suppressed multiplied by the input activation profiles outlined. This firing rate is thus a unitless fraction between 0 and 1, for ease of calculations.</p>
                  
                  <p>Simulated as transformed cortical neurons, the cortical cells that have been potentiated -- during a process known as systems consolidation, where hippocampus (HC) memories become independent over time -- are calculated as a function of stimulus exposure and multiplied by an incidental learning factor. Initiated at zero, the incidental learning factor is linearly additive, increasing based on the activity of the central medial amygdala (CEm). In a similar manner during consolidation, the cortical inhibitory interneuronal firing rate, a product of implicit learning, becomes independent of hippocampal activity, instead becoming stimulus dependent.  This results in sustained activity during a the playing of a tone (CS)  in the LA of post-conditioned rats, as observed in prior studies. Modeled as the ‘output,’ the firing rate of the CEm directly determines the degree of freezing, as well as the implicit learning and incidental learning factors, thus making the degree of freezing, an observable behavior, the measure of learning. The LA principal neuronal activity is one input to the basal amygdala (BL); the hippocampal, cortical principal and cortical inhibitory neural activity constitute the others. </p>

The implicit learning factor used here is the same as the aforementioned.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Degree of Freezing</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/mouse-freeze.PNG" alt="">
                  
                  <p>At the beginning of each experiment the overall activity level and ratio of active neurons is determined for the LA and BL. These values are re-evaluated if implicit learning has occurred during the previous trial of the experiment and are then used to characterize the membrane potential of the distal and proximal compartments of principal LA and BL cells, as well as that of inhibitory LA and BL cells. The firing rate of the principal and inhibitory neurons in the LA and BL are calculated from these depolarization values.</p>
                  <p>If the BL is not suppressed then the activation profile of the CEm is a function of the BL, otherwise it’s a function of the LA. Of course, if the CEm is suppressed there is no activity. If there is no shock (US), then the degree of freezing is a function of the activity in the CEm, otherwise freezing is set to 0 to mimic the jolt reaction to a shock. Freezing scores are between 0 and 1, with 1 being no movement and 0 being maximum movement. If the degree of freezing determined for the current trial is greater than that for the previous trial, then learning has occurred, and the smeared freezing score is linearly increased by the difference between the current un-smeared freezing score and the previous smeared freezing score. Smearing, in this instance, refers to moderating the rise of freezing by 90% to mimic imperfect memory. If the current freezing score is less than the previous intervals smeared freezing score then forgetting has occurred, for which the smeared freezing score for the current trial would be that of the prior trial, decreased by the difference between the previous smeared freezing score and the current un-smeared freezing score. This difference is multiplied by 30% to moderate the fall rate of freezing. As freezing is the method through which learning is characterized, it is important to ensure that freezing increases with learning and decreases with forgetting.</p>
                  <p>Existing literature on the neural circuit of the fear conditioning pathway has concluded that freezing induces the release of neuromodulators from the VTA and LE. Whilst neither specific neuromodulators nor their receptors were modeled in silico, their effects were. The CEm connects to a downstream inhibitory neuron. As a function of the CEm, this Omega neuron activates if the firing rate of the CEm surpasses the threshold for freezing. Because a strongly conditioned stimulus should block the learning of a new stimulus presented together with it, the Omega neuron inhibits the primary reinforcement neuron (U neuron). Activity of the X neuron increases, as a result of disinhibition from the Omega neuron. The X neuron simulates the neural state of the brain at low concentrations of neuromodulators (NM), lowering synaptic connectivity in the basolateral amygdala, as described in (Pendyam et al., 2011).</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="images/flowchart.png" alt="">
                  <h4>Need</h4>
                  <p>This project primarily fulfills a research need. By identifying and characterizing the componenta and how they connect to form a neural circuit, and further analyzing how certain inputs are translated to corresponding outputs, this project progresses our current understanding of brain and behavior. At the most generic level, this work contributes to knowledge necessary for clinical neuroscience studies. However, with the development of a responsive virtual reality, encompassing a biomimetic model, this project has the potential to shorten experimental periods between neural trials since a virtual model can be used instead of the living analogue, with the actual living organism’s output used only as a later stage experimental confirmation of results</p>
                  
                  <h4>Anything Holding Us Back?</h4>
                  
                  <p>The brain is the most complex organ in the human body, so mimicking its function is a complicated endeavor with plenty of constraints. Time proved a large constraint, as the lack of it limited our ability to work with live rats, running parallel experiments to directly match biological observations with the in silico output, as well as our ability to implement gamma oscillations in the circuitry of the model. This unification is a continuing goal for future steps. In modeling the pathway, simplifications were made for ease of calculations. Individual neuromodulatory effects on the Pavlovian pathway were not modeled in silico because of the complexity of single cell models with specific receptors, but by representative neurons. Variables used were matched to values reported in prior studies. Although gamma oscillations were not explicitly modeled, by the time of this report, we alternatively decided to incorporate the overlapping mechanistic features of the fear conditioning pathway and gamma oscillations in the code. Overall, the study successfully met its core objective: to analyze the functional components of the fear conditioning pathway in the amygdala, with respect to learning. </p>
                  <h4>Ethics</h4>
                  <p> It is generally seen as less objectionable to test on low order in-vitro cellular networks, than on higher order species, such as monkeys. Research will involve rat subjects as a means to procure amygdaloid slice cultures, used to assess validity of the in silico model. Rats are the simplest possible, or least sentient, species of animal appropriate, as they are an organism that has learning capability. The stage of data collection involves the conditioning  of adult rats through footshocks, in order to invoke fear of a pain and trigger the fear conditioning pathway.  Pain is the most  controllable and precise method of triggering the fear response necessary for conditioning. Beyond the necessary pain trigger of a small caliber shock (0.7mA, 0.2s) there will be no undue, lasting pain for the subject. Moreover, the subject will be anesthetized before slice collection, subjects were euthanized after the procedure. It is also important to note that the minimum number of animals consistent with ensuring scientific objectives will be used.</p>
                  <h4>Social Impact</h4>
                  <p> The significance of studying the amygdala is rooted in its function. It is critical in emotional adaptive behavior, and the source of many neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in developing youth. Previous studies have implicated amygdala dysfunction in anxiety disorders, addiction, and complex neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism. As research on the amygdala advances, it’ll open the way to the development of new treatments of psychiatric disorders.</p>
                  <p><u>Competition: what else is going on in the field that would compete with the project plans?</u> In short terms, not really. In long terms: the exploration of learned fear that includes not only analysis of neural architecture and neuromodulators but also of neural synchrony via oscillatory effects is uncommon. This is in part because of the deft of information known about the mechanism behind neural oscillations, leading to their exclusion in many in silico models. Moreover, the niche knowledge and expertise needed for both carrying out biologically validating experiments and programming a computational model means that only a blending of Biomedical Engineering principles and Computational Neuroscience would allow for a decisive exploration of the subject matter.</p>
